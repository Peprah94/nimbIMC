## Introduction

* Increase in biodiversity data

* Biodiversity data subject to biases/noise

* Develop statistical framework to model species distribution whilst accounting for biases


## Study 1: A structural model for the process of collecting biodiversity data



## Study 1

* Concept of how biodiversity data is collected

* General statistical framework to model biases

* sources of biases : 
  + uneven sampling effort
  + detection probability
  + Misclassification / Misidentification
